# QLink-ACMW 21 Hackathon
1. In this fastly growing world, we always want to connect with people and build a community with  people having the same interests.Now the question is how you can do that. One way is, people find their friends and peer group in college or school. But what about those who are introverts or as we all know these all things are going online nowadays due to pandemic and  it is highly needed to have a social platform where people with same interest across the world can connect and discuss things by building different communities..  

2.  We are always curious about new technologies in that field. In the way of learning something new we all face problems or have doubts like what would be good resources, what would be the prerequisites etc. In that case it will always give us the upper hand if we have a mentor or an experienced person's guidance.

3. And the last problem which i think all the students face in the college for any team event is formation of the team u can also take example of this hackathon. Well if u are new in that particular field then no one counts you in their team then the one tedious way is to approach every person you can guess can take part well by  this sometimes students lose the motivation to participate.

Don’t worry guys, we aren't just here to make you feel that how many problems u have in your life but we are also giving u the ultimate solution to all these problems which is Qlink (Our website).

As we all know in today’s time we have many platforms to connect with people, for asking our doubts and helping others by answering their questions, to find things related to our interest. So what’s the need of Qlink? That would be the first question raised in your mind.Qlink has many features but in short now you can get all these things in one and only platform which is Qlink.

1. Our website helps people to interact with each other even in this pandemic period when all the schools and colleges are going online. It connects people according to their interest, hobbies and passion. We can easily find a suitable peer group on our website in which we can ask doubts and share our thoughts.

2. Sometimes when students get doubts, usually they hesitate to ask them so here on our website we get an option to ask questions anonymously. In this page you can post all your silly questions without getting revealed :)

3. If someone wants to learn or share about new technology then there is a blog type section where anyone can post about any topic or any experience and from here you can also approach the experienced person .

4. Especially, in this pandemic time, everyone is stuck at their homes so they are facing issues in their studies or if they want to know or discuss about any new thing, then they can join or build communities and discuss with people of similar interests freely.....
